\fBLogging\fR \- Why, What & How we Log
.SS Description
.P
The \fBnpm\fP CLI has various mechanisms for showing different levels of information back to end\-users for certain commands, configurations & environments\.
.SS Setting Log Levels
.SS \fBloglevel\fP

\fBloglevel\fP is a global argument/config that can be set to determine the type of information to be displayed\.

.RE
.SS \fBforeground\-scripts\fP
.P
The \fBnpm\fP CLI began hiding the output of lifecycle scripts for \fBnpm install\fP as of \fBv7\fP\|\. Notably, this means you will not see logs/output from packages that may be using "install scripts" to display information back to you or from your own project's scripts defined in \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\. If you'd like to change this behavior & log this output you can set \fBforeground\-scripts\fP to \fBtrue\fP\|\.
.SS Registry Response Headers
.SS \fBnpm\-notice\fP
.P
The \fBnpm\fP CLI reads from & logs any \fBnpm\-notice\fP headers that are returned from the configured registry\. This mechanism can be used by third\-party registries to provide useful information when network\-dependent requests occur\.
.P
This header is not cached, and will not be logged if the request is served from the cache\.
