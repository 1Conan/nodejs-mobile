c-ares version 1.16.0

Changes:
 o Introduction of ares_getaddrinfo() API which provides similar output
   (including proper sorting as per RFC 6724) to the system native API, but
   utilizes different data structures in order to provide additional information
   such as TTLs and all aliases.  Please reference the respective man pages for
   usage details. [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [22]
 o Parse SOA records from ns_t_any response [29] [30]
 o CMake: Provide c-ares version in package export file [24]
 o CMake: Add CPACK functionality for DEB and RPM [28]
 o CMake: Generate PDB files during build [33] [34]
 o CMake: Support manpage installation [37] [38]

Bug fixes:
 o Fix bad expectation in IPv6 localhost test. [1] [2]
 o AutoTools: use XC_CHECK_BUILD_FLAGS instead of XC_CHECK_USER_FLAGS to prevent
   complaints about CPPFLAGS in CFLAGS. [6]
 o Fix .onion handling
 o Command line usage was out of date for adig and ahost. [18]
 o Typos in manpages [19] [20]
 o If ares_getenv is defined, it must return a value on all platforms [21]
 o If /etc/resolv.conf has invalid lookup values, use the defaults. [23]
 o Tests: Separate live tests from SetServers* tests as only live tests should
   require internet access. [25]
 o ares_gethostbyname() should return ENODATA if no valid A or AAAA record is
   found, but a CNAME was found. [26] [27]
 o CMake: Rework library function checking to prevent unintended linking with
   system libraries that aren't needed. [31] [32]
 o Due to use of inet_addr() it was not possible to return 255.255.255.255 from
   ares_gethostbyname(). [35] [36]
 o CMake: Fix building of tests on Windows
